# MODELING CARDIAC CELL BIOPHYSICS USING DEEP LONG-SHORT MEMORY NETWORKS 

Accurate numerical biophysical models can be employed to elucidate mechanisms of cardiac rhythm 
disorders and their clinical implications. The predictive modeling has been increasingly used to investigate 
the missing link between experimental observations and clinical translation. Recently, Akwaboah et al.
(Akwaboah et al., 2021) formulated a detailed model of hiPSC-CMs which is able to accurately reproduce 
the biophysical dynamics of hiPSC-CMs. HiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) have recently been used successfully in studying cardiac safety pharmacology and various inherited as well as acquired cardiac arrhythmia disorders (Moretti et al., 2010). The model consists of ionic current formulations of 14 key channels, pumps and exchangers along with intracellular calcium homeostasis. The model was used to 
provide insights into the causes of the experimentally observed suppression of automaticity in hiPSC-CMs 
during cholinergic stimulation.

In this study, we propose a deep LSTM (DLSTM) model for predicting the AP of an hiPSC-CM. A 
DLSTM consists of multiple cascaded LSTM layers operating at different time scales (Pascanu et al., 
2014). This method can perform an ordered process for capturing data patterns in a complex temporal task. 
We utilized two different DLSTM architectures to compare the performance of AP time series prediction.

Our deep neural network architecture uses a combination of LSTM layers, dropout (to decrease 
overfitting), and fully connected dense layers. To achieve the most effective network, we implemented
two different architectures. The first architecture used two back-to-back LSTM layers followed by three fully-connected dense layers. This network will be referred to as DLSTM2. The second architecture, shown in Figure 3B, composed of three back-to-back LSTM layers, one dropout, and three fully-connected dense layers. This network will be referred to as DLSTM3.

 Over the years, various attempts have been made towards explaining and reproducing the electrical activity of the heart. A variety of models has been proposed, ranging from mechanistic to empirical, and considering the heart at the cellular level through to tissues or even the organ as a whole. While some of these models answered some “big questions” in the field, one major challenge that persists is the computational complexity of these models. With the emergence of deep learning techniques, it has become relatively easy to build and deploy empirical “data-driven” models. This offers a wealth of opportunities for gaining new insight into the workings of the heart that current models are unable to offer.
 
For the training, we chose Mean Square Error (MSE) loss function and Adam optimizer for adaptive
learning rate (Goodfellow et al., 2016). The batch size was chosen to be 12. The data was randomly divided 
into 80% for training and the remaining 20% for testing. Scaling factors for the maximum conductance of 
five main ion currents: INa, IKur, IKr, IK1 and ICaL, were used as inputs to both the networks.

 The data used to train this model was synthetically generated by an in silico hiPSC-Derived Cardiomyocyte Model built with a genetic algorithm created by Akwasi D. Akwaboah, Bright Tsevi, Pascal Yamlome, Jacqueline A. Treat, Maila Brucal-Hallare, Jonathan M. Cordeiro and Makarand Deo. Using the hiPSC model, we blocked  and raised the values of  ICaL, IK1, IKr, IKur and INa currents from 0% to 200% in steps of 20% to generate our data.  In each interaction, it was produced 100,000 ms of action potential. To train our model, we collected 3 samples of 10,000 ms from the 100,000 ms created due to the high memory 100,000 ms takes to be training  in a LSTM model.

To create the network architecture, we built a model with three layers. First, we used a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with 5 input neurons, each representing the current values, and 12,000 output neurons; Second, it was a Dense layer with 12,000 input and output neurons; My last layer was Dense layer with 12,000 input neurons and 10,0000 out neurons which represented the action potential predicted.  To compile, we used loss as mean squared error and optimizer as RMSprop. In total the model had 840,310,000 parameters.

We trained the DLSTM2 model for 923 epochs and DLSTM3 model for 1175 epochs. Each epoch was 
completed in an average 2.5 minutes and 6 minutes for DLSTM2 and DLSTM3 models, respectively,
using a CPU environment. Table below lists the performance metrics MAPE for the outcome of 
models when compared with the Akwaboah et al. model (Akwaboah et al., 2021). MAPE measures the difference between the predicted and actual values of APD50, APD75, APD90 and APDall. The Gaussian σ values for smoothing out the predicted signal were varied between 1 to 7 in steps of 0.1. The best value of σ was found to be 2.2 for DLSTM2 and 2.1 for DLSTM3 model.

The Figuressbelow representative examples of the AP produced by the DLSTM models for various scaling of ionic currents. The predictions of DLSTM3 model were smoother than the DLSTM2 model. However, in both models some noise was observed during AP plateau (Phase 2-3) and diastolic interval (Phase 0) despite Gaussian smoothing.

The models were trained with data from alterations in five main ionic current components that contribute to the action potentials in these cells. The model with 3 cascaded LSTM layers reproduce the action potential morphology with accuracy closer to 99%. These models were able to faithfully reproduce experimentally observed behaviors of ion channel blocks and drug interactions in cardiomyocytes. Further study should involve creating further finetuned models with the capacity to manipulate more currents, stimulus conditions, and refractory periods.
